## Quick Start

Run the following on three different terminals (you can understand that these three different terminals simulate three different host nodes):

```sh
# node 0
python millionaire.py --party_id=0
```

```sh
# node 1
python millionaire.py --party_id=1
```

```sh
# node 2
python millionaire.py --party_id=2
```

Output:

```sh
ret: 1.0
```

**Enjoy!**
